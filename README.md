# Covid19Dashboard-Project

The dashboard aims to analyze trends and patterns in COVID-19 data, particularly related to patients and fatalities, emphasizing the importance of geographical occurrence and mortality rates. By studying the dashboard, it becomes evident that proactive measures and patient isolation are essential in reducing infection rates. Moreover, the analysis reveals a direct correlation between the progression of the epidemic and the number of cases and deaths in certain countries, suggesting the severity of the disease's impact. Notably, Hong Kong, China, experiences a significant rise in fatalities compared to Western countries like Israel, highlighting the necessity for increased preventive and responsive measures in regions with a disproportionate number of deaths relative to patient numbers.

*** This project was developed as part of an Vizualization course during my first degree in Digital Medical Tecnologies.
